-- Notice how the first two and the last two are actually the same function, just with different types.
-- This shows how binding and return accomplish different tasks depending on the working monad.

-- Q: What would this code do for the IO monad?
-- A: The function would read 3 numbers and add them, wrapping the result into an IO:

add5 :: IO Int -> IO Int -> IO Int -> IO Int
add5 a b c =
    do x <- a
       y <- b
       z <- c
       return (x + y + z)

-- *Main> add5 readLn readLn readLn
-- 3
-- 10
-- 200
-- 213

-- Here's code that finds the sum of the odd elements of a read array

f = sum . (filter odd)

main = do
	inputdata <- getContents
	putStrLn $ show $ f $ map (read :: String -> Int) $ lines inputdata

-- Notice the usage of show, read and lines (non-monadic functions) together with
-- getContents and putStrLn (monadic functions)

-- Small cosmetic change.
